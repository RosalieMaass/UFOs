# UFOs
## Overview
In this project we were tasked with designing a website to show UFO sightings from across the world. The website contains a table with data from every recorded UFO sighting and a filter bar so the sightings can be filtered by date, location, and shape. There are additional columns that have comments and duration of the sighting.

## Results
The results should show a well constructed website with many filter options on the lefthand side. When entering filter options the table on the right should populate based on the input. I was unable to get the code to work correctly to get the filter function to work properly. This is disappointing.

## Summary
In summary, ideally, this is a very well put together website that contains cohesive information that is easy to read. When the filters work, they make searching the data easy and the information is clearly displayed.
